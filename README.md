* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the design and construction of your pipeline and incorporation of intermediate Python concepts as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* You must construct a data pipeline with the majority of your code wrapped in functions.
* Each data pipeline stage should be covered: acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and reporting.
* You must demonstrate all the topics we covered in the chapter (functions, list comprehensions, string operations, and error handling) in your processing of the data.
* There should be some data set that gets imported and some result that gets exported.
* Your code should be saved in a Python executable file (.py), your data should be saved in a folder named data, and your results should be saved in a folder named output.
* You should also include a README.md file that describes the steps you took and your thought process as you built your data pipeline.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A Python (.py) code file** that contains the code for your data pipeline.
* **A data folder** containing your data set.
* **An output folder** containing the output of your data pipeline.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the design and construction of your pipeline and incorporation of intermediate Python concepts as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.
